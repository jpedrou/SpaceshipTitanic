# About Dataset
the dataset is from a competition on  <img align = 'center' width = 50 src="https://github.com/jpedrou/SpaceshipTitanic/assets/127536464/7caf8110-4a9a-4641-9d5c-56eabf9af8f2">. You can check more [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data).

Columns: 
- `PassengerId` - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.

- `HomePlanet` - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.
  
- `CryoSleep` - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.
  
- `Cabin` - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.
  
- `Destination` - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.
  
- `Age` - The age of the passenger.
  
- `VIP` - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.
  
- `RoomService`, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.
  
- `Name` - The first and last names of the passenger.
  
- `Transported` - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.

# Neural Networks
In this case were used different libraries of Neural Networks.
